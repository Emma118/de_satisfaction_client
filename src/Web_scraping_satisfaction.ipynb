I have been a customer of crypto dispensers since 2020 and i've been enjoying their services. are there some days which I feel are bad? yeah there are few times due to maybe system downtime or customer service help and yes they're prompt in resolving any issues you may be having.\\nif you want to start a journey with cryptocurrency investment then you just found the right place to do that as it makes it so seamless to access cryptocurrencies with cash at the CDreload and now that they have added the features of debit/credit card transaction, it's another milestone achievement towards their dedication to their services.\\nI would like to make a few little suggestions which i feel may be helpful to their customers. it's about the daily limit on the CDrelaod if it can be reviewed and as well the barcode deposit limit also. there should be increase in the daily limit of certain customers and it would be more easier if someone can make large deposit on the barcodes at once like lets say $2000 as it saves time instead of having to be creating barcode for each deposits and having to wait till next day before another deposit could be made. also, I would suggest if crypto dispenser could have a medium for live chat to their CSR so as to be able to instill more confidence in their customers and potential customers. Thank you.\\nthough crypto dispensers remains my go to for my crypto asset as it's very easy and seamless to buy with their services.

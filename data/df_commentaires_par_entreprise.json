Was denied because apparently it’s a new account and my check would have to be held for seven days before the funds were available. This does not work for me, I live on a limited income and have bills to pay. It’s been almost 2 weeks since I opened my account. I still have not received a debit card which is why I was requesting cash back from the phones I was depositing I also use Venmo quite often, yet , I discovered after opening the account that liberty first does not allow you to use Venmo. A lot of people use Venmo these days. It would really make it helpful to folks if they were still able to use this app. I get money and I send money through Venmo a lot .",

This does deactivate the previous cards for security reasons. Your cards are currently in the USPS system and this is why we advise to wait a few more days.

        "commentaire": "Don't trust the service. I had large transactions with the owner of crypto dispensers directly back in March 2024. Crypto dispenser forced me to remove his name here but anyone can easily google the owner to find out who he is. I Experienced frequent delays and unresponsive calls/texts during the period of using his service. He often used my large funds to fund his smaller transactions on the website first, causing months of delay for me. When my project passed deadline due to his delays and caused me significant financial losses, I asked him to cancel the transactions he's delayed and held. He THEN sends them through anyway just to make up volumn for his investors, charged me a big% fee on top. When confronted, he promised the return of the fees on the transactions he made PASSING the promised delivery date it's now 4 months later. He's still dodging my calls, txts, messages, still owe me thousands.\n\nMy over all experience, crypro dispenser is ran by someone who's not reliable, he promises the world when he wants your money, then dodges your calls when he owes you. The owner thanked me on the phone because my volumn got him investors for his business, and then makes promises and disapears. I'm still very upset that I can't locate him after my losses and his missing promises. I had all conversations and all my attempts to reach him recorded as evidence.\n\nIf you are protective of your money and crypto, and you have relatively high volumn, or you are considering investing in his business, bare in mind this is NOT a reliable man or business.",

After generically responding to my emails reaching out to support to fulfill my reward THAT THEY EMAILED ME OFFERING, they come on this public forum and cunningly respond to my review as if they intended to help. Only to turn around and send the same email saying they haven’t received what they need from me in order to provide the incentive that once again they sought me out to engage in. They emailed me a few days after my first cash load and said hey if u like us write a 5star review and we’ll give u $10. Mind you I’ve been a customer with this company for multiple years and would use the site more if the fees weren’t so high and capabilities so minimal. However they flooded my emails with this promotion to receive $25 for first deposit, when I did it I wasn’t impressed because once again after all the fees you end up earning about $5 give or take some change! I went on about my life and here they come in my email offering an incentive to encourage 5star reviews. They didn’t follow through or respond to my emails so I had to take to this public forum which triggered a response from them. The response was remove my second review or they won’t fulfill the reward and threatened to disable my account for “abusing bonuses” DID I MENTION THEY REACHED OUT TO ME IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE OF MY REVIEW. Needless to say I told them I WILL NOT REMOVE MY REVIEW UNTIL THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR END! Their response, sorry to have to do this but it’s come to our attention you are abusing rewards so we are disabling your account! That response came promptly and directed towards me personally not a generic response given by a computer. So they had found time to follow up on this matter when i inboxed them for about 3weeks with limited responses due to them claiming to be a startup business! They’ve been around for at least 3years, their phone number that is published on the internet is no connected but they have personnel available to disable accounts yet no one on their staff to pay their phone bill or get a service they can manage to keep! BAD BUSINESS!!!",

Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what’s best for your business.

Not spending countless hours on the phone just to try to get my money; and they were there when needed. It is great to know some banks still value customer interaction and face to face transactions. In the age when people pretend to be other people, Meriwest provides me ample security, safety, and peace of mind in knowing they can’t be defrauded putting my money in safe hands.",

After multiple attempts, I final sent a registered letter to close my account back in March, and have yet to get my money back (now May). They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.\n\nBottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.",

Heritage sent me a letter in the mail about “pre qualification” awesome I’ll give it a go I’ve had my car for some time maybe there’s a lower/better rate. Mark sent me a message after I applied for my refinance that he already had me matched with a few lenders. I mixed up 2 numbers on my application as I have slight dyslexia, he then tells me that everyone has denied my application…after he told me he already had me matched and he was putting numbers together. I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they’ll get back but the end of the month is busy for “new applications only” so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application…fine no big deal. It has now been a month. I feel like I’ve been pretty patient and I saw good reviews about the company before I had applied. However, this is just my experience. Take it as you will.",

They have always gone far and beyond to help me. I do believe people need to make sure they are adding a review on the right business.",

But its has been too long for me not to use my card at my convenience to pay the company back in their store. I reached out to customer service sweet lady she did not understand why Florence muscle shoals and Athens more than likely card readers are not working for their customers. She patched me thru to the district manager, for her to be a district manager she is top line unprofessional rude and disrespectful. The loyalty and respect don’t like up in this district starting with the district manager and i will not refer a soul!",

        "commentaire": "This app is so useless and full of fraudulent acts. One of their online marketers called my phone to advertise this useless app to me, firstly I refused that I needed not to borrow, he finally convinced me. After I installed the app, I requested for a loan at the end I was not ok with the offer then I neglected it, only for me to wake up the next morning to discover money paid into my account from this app without my approval. I was shocked because I was supposed to accept this offer before the money can be disbursed into my account but in this case no, it wasn't like that. Immediately I had to send email messages to the email addresses I saw online but didn't get any response. I tried to call the fool who contacted me to advertise the app to me but his number was not been reachable. To worsen the case, a week later their online customer started sending messages, death threats, posting negative things about me. I had to call the WhatsApp number that sent me messages and this foolish girl had the nerves to start laying curses on me and my family because of a token I never bargained for. Please guys, to avoid the type of experience and embarrassment I got from these app, please I advise you avoid this app. They are thieves in disguise.",

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location. I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

I asked could the notary come over (1/1/2 miles away from the branch) so that she could sign the forms needed and help her. They said NO, our notaries are only able to do their job in the branch office. I asked which notary we could use to accomplish this, the Branch Manager said we cannot accept any other one??? I escalated a complaint, that person Asia, said same thing, I asked for who at PNC cared about Customer Service, and she said she would escalate another 48 hour wait to Executive Client Relations. I requested someone else higher up, but she said that was not possible. THEN I called the 4 numbers online, all rabbit holes. NO one is accountable, if I were you I would ask MORE questions about what matters, \"customer service or money? I would take my money and run.

        "commentaire": "I've been a customer with PNC for a decade, but am in the process of switching to a new bank. PNC has become incredibly aggressive to the point of predatory with their overdraft fees. They take longer than other banks to clear transactions and update balances, and then happily charge $36 for every transaction that comes through while an account is negative. This is plainly profiting on customer's struggles, and I imagine the increased aggression has something to do with the fact that they know the CFPB is working to cut overdraft fees to a reasonable amount. Their online banking system is also outdated, clunky, difficult to navigate, and as stated before, balances are almost never correct, which makes it incredibly hard to stay on top of it. I don't recommend becoming a customer with them at all.",

Refused to deposit my check into my account because my husband's name was on it.\nWhen I called they told me to wait for the check to come.\nAfter 2 weeks I called and after being put on hold for an hour and being refused a supervisor I was then told that dept was closed.\nThey called be a day later and told me the photocopied check was actually real and I needed to bring it into a branch again!\nThey owe me 5% interest for a month now on $3500 and are refusing to give it to me.\nI deposited the check into a different bank with no problem.",

        "commentaire": "We had made money orders to pay our rent. We turned them into the complex office and they informed us that they do not accept money orders. So we went to the bank (pnc bank in Walnut Creek Ca) to see if we can deposit the money orders in exchange for a cashiers check. Absolutely worst decision we could've ever made.... the clerk took our money orders and filed them into a fraud case! We had our identification, we had receipts, we had everything to prove that we bought them... but they took our money orders against our will and then when we spoke to the manager, she claimed it's not their fault.... like hellloooo, you guys took our money orders and filled them for fraud! Now, we're out of our entire rent check and they just laughed it off like it wasn't a big deal.... if you value your time and your money. You will stay far away from pnc bank. They will try to get you arrested for simply wanting to use their services to pay bills. I wish I could give a zero star rating. Absolute joke of a bank. They 1000000% don't trust their customers and will do you no good in any aspect of banking",

They also shut my car down when my payment was late, even though it was only $100, late by one week,and I had a $7,500 credit limit.",

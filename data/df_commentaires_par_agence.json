The posting was done by Cloudflare.\nThe potential for a possible scam or worse gave me pause before answering. The 'authentication' (I guess) somehow gave sufficient proof so I was then able to log into my account.\nI also had a rather minor request to edit the names on specific accounts.\nMy call was taken by Danielle and together we were able to address and resolve.\nHaving employees who feel professional yet personable service are critical in securing confidence in both Evergreen and their employees.\nYour mission and mine were met by Danielle.",

I still have not received a debit card which is why I was requesting cash back from the phones I was depositing I also use Venmo quite often, yet , I discovered after opening the account that liberty first does not allow you to use Venmo.

We regret that this did not resolve your situation more quickly and understand why this has been a source of significant frustration for you.\n\nRegarding your difficulty in reaching our customer service, we are taking measures to improve our response times and availability. Our goal is to be readily accessible to all our customers, and we fell short in this instance.\n\nWe respect your decision to express your dissatisfaction through your review.

        "commentaire": "Using Crypto Dispensers' CDReload service has been a revelation for me. It's the perfect solution for buying Bitcoin with cash. I love the convenience of topping up my account at familiar retail stores like CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, Casey\u2019s, and many more. Not only is the process incredibly user-friendly, but the rates are also notably more affordable than Bitcoin ATMs \u2013 almost half the cost! It genuinely feels like having a portable Bitcoin ATM right in the palm of my hand. If you're looking for a seamless, cost-effective way to delve into the world of cryptocurrency, CDReload is the way to go!",

I have been a customer of crypto dispensers since 2020 and i've been enjoying their services. are there some days which I feel are bad? yeah there are few times due to maybe system downtime or customer service help and yes they're prompt in resolving any issues you may be having.\nif you want to start a journey with cryptocurrency investment then you just found the right place to do that as it makes it so seamless to access cryptocurrencies with cash at the CDreload and now that they have added the features of debit/credit card transaction, it's another milestone achievement towards their dedication to their services.\nI would like to make a few little suggestions which i feel may be helpful to their customers. it's about the daily limit on the CDrelaod if it can be reviewed and as well the barcode deposit limit also. there should be increase in the daily limit of certain customers and it would be more easier if someone can make large deposit on the barcodes at once like lets say $2000 as it saves time instead of having to be creating barcode for each deposits and having to wait till next day before another deposit could be made. also, I would suggest if crypto dispenser could have a medium for live chat to their CSR so as to be able to instill more confidence in their customers and potential customers. Thank you.\nthough crypto dispensers remains my go to for my crypto asset as it's very easy and seamless to buy with their services. I wish i can give more than 5 stars\n\nCryptoDispensers the best to ever be and the best that will ever be.",

After multiple attempts, I final sent a registered letter to close my account back in March, and have yet to get my money back (now May). They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested). I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.\n\nBottom line: I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again. They certainly put profits ahead of customer satisfaction.",

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location. I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

        "commentaire": "I have an investment with PNC that I took out in 2017 when bank was still BBVA. The investment officer at branch bank in Hurst Texas on Bedford Euless rd was Eddie Gassoway. I had couple of meetings with him about investing $18,000, and expressed to him him that I wanted something safe that would be guaranteed to lose no value, but make me a little over a ten year period. I was just beginning to draw SSA benefits and trying to retire from self employment of 50 years. Eddie talked me into a market indexed CD that at minimum would return me $23,000 at end of ten years. Not good now, but acceptable then. When I got my first six month statement value of CD had dropped to around $17,000, so I went in to talk over with Eddie and he assured me that it just appeared that way, but there had actually been no drop in value. Long story short it's six years later, value of CD is now around $14,000. When I went in about six months ago they told me no worry at end of ten years I would still have my $18,000. I responded that I could have left under mattress for ten years and still had $18,000. At this point no officer at this band will even discuss the investment with me but they do give me an 800 # that I can call. Banked at this branch since 1999 since they were Guarantee, and this is the customer service u get from them. Just closed out personal and business checking accounts on 5/7/24. Looks like I am just going to have to close out CD and take loss of thousands since no one will talk to me from bank. PNC has got to be the pariah of the banking system please don't even consider them",

So extremely inconsistent answers to the same, simple question.\nThe second and third customer service agent also tried putting the blame on the post office. But it is PNC's fault for not putting tracking on a debit card being sent through the postal service. The postal service has enough issues but sending a small envelope from the corporate office in either cinncinnati or Cleveland where they process the debit card to just outside of Pittsburgh takes up to 10 days? That's entirely not on the postal service, because you can receive a postal package from California in less then 10 days. That is 100% the responsibility of PNC for sending a debit card that way and giving customers inconsistent answers of how long it should take.\nAbsolutely absurd and disgusting for a debit card to take up to 10 days to be delivered.",
